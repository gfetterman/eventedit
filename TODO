# TODO

+ requests/refactors from meeting with KJB 2/15/17:
  1. replace list+pc organization with undo + redo stacks
  2. option option for kwargs to lc_env and lass in labels that way
  4. remove event_file from init, and hash labels directly
  6. write context managers (enter and exit) for stack
  7. make merge handle intervening unlabeled time by including starts & stops
